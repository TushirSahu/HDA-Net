## Overview
This repository contains code for detecting and classifying diabetic retinopathy using attention modules. Diabetic retinopathy is a severe eye disease that affects individuals with diabetes, causing damage to the retina and potentially leading to vision loss. The attention modules help in highlighting important regions in retinal images, aiding in accurate detection and classification of diabetic retinopathy.

<!-- This README provides an overview of the project, installation instructions, usage guidelines, and other relevant information. -->

## Features
### Diabetic retinopathy detection
The attention modules analyze retinal images to identify signs of diabetic retinopathy.
Attention mechanism: The code implements attention modules that focus on relevant regions in the retinal images for improved detection accuracy.
### Classification
The system classifies the severity of diabetic retinopathy into different stages, aiding in appropriate medical intervention.
### Easy integration
The code can be easily integrated into existing healthcare systems or used as a standalone application for diabetic retinopathy detection.
